Hi, I am Bj√∂rn Johansson, assistant Professor at the Department of Biology, University of Minho where I teach and do research. Yeast physiology, molecular biology and biotechnology make my day :heartpulse:! I am also a passionate self-taught Python programmer.

Outside biology, I am interested in bioinformatics and [open reproducible science](https://datascience.stanford.edu/news/center-open-and-reproducible-science-cores-fall-lecture-series). Look at our group [website](https://metabolicengineeringgroupcbma.github.io) for more information. I am also an open-source software enthusiast using Linux on the desktop since 2007.

I reside in Portugal for many years. On my free time, I try to run :runner: as much as I can, I am on [runkeeper](https://runkeeper.com).
